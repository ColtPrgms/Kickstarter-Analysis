# Kickstarting with Excel

### Overview of Project
    Analzye Kickstarter data to maximize success of client's upcoming project.

#### Purpose
    This project was designed to analyze trends, success/failure, and finance goals of Kickstarters, with a focus on Theater categories.
### Analysis and Challenges

#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    When comparing the month a Theater Kickstarter project is started over a nine year period ('09 to '16) and its successfullness on reaching its goal, there is a spike in successful projects that implies that May is the best time to start a theater project.

#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    When comparing the outcome of a Kickstarter projects in the "play" category to their fundrasing goal over a nine year period ('09 to '16), the data shows two "sweet-spots" that are more likely to reach their requested goals. The first sweet spot would be between $0.00 and $4,999 and the second being between $35,000 and $44,999 (all amounts are in USD.)

#### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

### Results
    From the two key data points we can infer the best Play Kickstarter project would be best started in May with a goal of less than $4,999USD or between $35,000USD and $44,999USD. to dive deeper into the data, comparing the number of backers to other factors such as outcomes, pledged amounts, or by category could lead to more information on the successfullness of a project. The original kickstarter data may have some limitation, by not including other factors that may have strong infulences in determining a projects success or failure. An example of one of these factors would be if any incentives were offered during the kickstarter.
